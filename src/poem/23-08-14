{% block verses %}
remember the bees who remain
when their hive gets loaded onto a truck,
off to some other far away farm

how long do they look
for their queen?

remember the starlings
who didn't realize the flock had headed south,
down the coast

when the sun sets
they'll miss their murmurations

remember the whales
breaking from the pod,
headed straight to shore

refusing to fall abyssal
we'd rather choke helpless in the sand
than be consumed
